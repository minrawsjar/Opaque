**Opaque is a post-quantum private settlement rail for USDC on Arc. It keeps four
linkages out of the settlement trail: wallet identity, payment timing, RPC/query
activity, and IP origin—coordinating key, spend, network, and release privacy in
one system.**

## The market gap

Most on-chain privacy systems protect only the final transaction. That leaves three earlier points of failure:

| Exposure | What breaks | Opaque’s answer |
|---|---|---|
| **Authorization** | A public elliptic-curve key can be harvested today and attacked later. | A FORS+C hash-based key controls an ERC-4337 smart account. |
| **Settlement** | A public transfer reveals the payer, recipient, and note linkage. | An eight-member hash-based MPC-in-the-head ring proves one eligible note was spent without naming it. |
| **Network origin** | RPCs and services can connect a wallet IP to a payment request. | Every wallet request uses a fresh three-hop ML-KEM onion path. |
| **Timing** | An immediate spend can be correlated with its funding event. | A confidential privacy window waits for stronger conditions or settles no later than the user’s deadline. |

**Our position:** Opaque is quantum-transition-ready private USDC infrastructure—not a privacy skin around a conventional wallet, and not a mixer that ignores network metadata.

## The confidential-payments market

Stablecoins are becoming the settlement layer for payroll, treasury movement,
merchant payouts, and cross-border value transfer. Those users need more than
a hidden calldata field: they need the payer’s authority, payment linkage,
execution time, and network origin to remain difficult to correlate.

Today’s confidential-payment options usually cover only one part of that
problem. A pool can hide the sending address while leaving RPC/IP metadata
visible; a conventional smart wallet can improve UX while retaining
elliptic-curve authorization; a privacy protocol can hide the transfer while
settling immediately into a predictable timing pattern. None provides one
coherent, post-quantum path from wallet authorization to network transport to
conditional settlement.

Opaque is built for that missing layer: **confidential USDC settlement that is
private at the key, transaction, timing, and network levels—and designed for
the day elliptic-curve cryptography can no longer be trusted.**

## The product in one payment

USDC deposit → fixed-denomination private note → local 8-member ring
  → sealed payment → 3-hop relay mesh → confidential privacy policy
  → Arc pool settlement → fresh Graph signals for the next payment

### What a private payment does—and does not—reveal

| Public on Arc | Kept private from the chain, RPC, and ordinary backend |
|---|---|
| A deposit is attributable by design. | Which eligible deposit supplied the private spend. |
| Pool denomination and the recipient at final settlement. | Sender identity, selected decoys, payment key, privacy threshold, and deadline. |
| Aggregate relay health and pool events. | Wallet IP, direct Graph query, and relay path. |

## Architecture

<a id="architecture"></a>

### Architecture diagrams

| Diagram | What it covers |
|---|---|
| [End-to-end architecture](diagrams/e2e.svg) | Wallet → ring → relay mesh → Graph → CRE → Arc settlement. |
| [Wallet and account authority](diagrams/wallet.svg) | ERC-4337 account flow, FORS+C authorization, and key lifecycle. |
| [Ring proof and note spend](diagrams/proof.svg) | Same-denomination ring construction, proof, nullifier, and pool spend. |
| [Graph privacy feedback loop](diagrams/graph.svg) | Intelligence signals, decoy/routing decisions, and feedback from settlement. |
| [CRE + Arc settlement](diagrams/cre-arc.svg) | Confidential policy release and Arc contract settlement path. |

| Layer | Crux | Technical implementation |
|---|---|---|
| **Quantum-safe authority** | A future quantum attacker should not turn a published account key into control of the wallet. | ERC-4337 v0.7 smart account; FORS+C signatures verified through Solidity and PQKeyRegistry; pre-committed rotation and bounded key use. |
| **Private settlement** | A pool pays the recipient without naming which note in an eight-member same-denomination set was opened. | Hash-based MPC-in-the-head ring proof, local note vault, one fresh nullifier, membership checks, and a post-quantum attestation gate. |
| **Network privacy** | Infrastructure should not see who asked to pay. | Three ML-KEM-768 onion layers, AES-256-GCM payload protection, padding, batching, delay, and operator-diverse paths. |
| **Privacy coordination** | Privacy is a condition, not a toggle. | The Graph’s Arc intelligence layer indexes public pool and relay signals; the wallet selects the strongest eligible decoys locally, while Chainlink CRE evaluates the sealed threshold/deadline policy. |

### The Graph closes the feedback loop

![The Graph privacy feedback loop](diagrams/graph.svg)

The Graph is Opaque’s **privacy coordination layer—the brain of Opaque’s privacy mechanism.** It helps the wallet select the strongest eligible decoys locally.

~~~text
ring signals: pool population · note age · ring reuse · concentration
mesh signals: reliability · batch occupancy · recent selection count · operator diversity
       ↓
local decoy selection + local Markov route policy + CRE release score
       ↓
settlement produces fresh signals for the next payment
~~~

The Graph Client composes that operational Arc state with an independent
standardized Arbitrum USDC context, and Privacy Sentinel exposes the combined
aggregate view through MCP. Read the full integration in [The Graph partner write-up](partner-docs/the-graph.md).

### Privacy Sentinel: the inspectable Graph product

Privacy Sentinel is the public interface to that composition. It publishes
aggregate ring readiness, mesh health, indexed-block freshness, and external
USDC context through a typed MCP surface—enough for a judge or agent to inspect
why privacy conditions are strong or weak, without exposing a user’s note,
recipient, route, or identity.

## Partner integrations

| Partner | What is live | Why it is core |
|---|---|---|
| **Arc + Circle** | USDC settlement, USDC gas, ERC-4337 accounts, seven denomination pools, CCTP V2 entry from Sepolia. | The product is programmable private USDC on Arc—not a token adapter. |
| **Chainlink CRE** | Active opaque-confidential-release workflow in AWS Nitro; Vault DON secrets; 30-second confidentiality policy ticks. | CRE is the authority that can release a sealed payment under the payer’s conditions. |
| **The Graph** | Arc intelligence layer for wallet/CRE coordination, plus a typed Graph Client composition with an independent Arbitrum USDC context and Privacy Sentinel MCP. | It makes privacy adaptive across payments and gives judges a reusable, inspectable Graph product—not a one-off query. |

## Security model, stated plainly

| Boundary | Enforced by | What it prevents |
|---|---|---|
| Account authority | PQKeyRegistry + PQ account validator | Conventional wallet key takeover and unauthorized rotation. |
| One spend per note | Pool nullifier state | Double-spending. |
| Ring eligibility | Pool membership validation | Synthetic/unknown decoy memberships. |
| Payment release terms | CRE envelope + MAC-bound decision | A backend altering recipient, privacy threshold, or deadline. |
| Route authority | Signed pinned relay directory | A Graph query inventing a relay identity or key. |
| Early release | Fresh, healthy Graph observations | Treating a stale or broken index as strong privacy. |

The current V1 proof verifier is split: the hash-based MPC-in-the-head proof is checked by the attester, while Arc enforces denomination, ring membership, one-time nullifier use, recipient binding, and the live post-quantum attestation. See the module contracts in [docs/interfaces.md](docs/interfaces.md).
