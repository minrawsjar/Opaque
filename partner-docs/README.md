![Opaque partner architecture](../diagrams/e2e.svg)

| Partner | The role it plays in Opaque | Judge-ready evidence |
|---|---|---|
| **[Arc + Circle](arc.md)** | Settlement chain, USDC money and gas, ERC-4337 accounts, denomination pools, CCTP V2 onboarding. | Live Arc addresses, USDC flow, CCTP transaction, deployment and source map. |
| **[Chainlink CRE](chainlink.md)** | Confidential authority for sealed privacy thresholds, deadlines, and payment-release decisions. | Active AWS Nitro workflow, Vault DON secrets, release flow, deployment evidence. |
| **[The Graph](the-graph.md)** | Privacy coordination layer: public conditions powering local decoys, Markov paths, and CRE readiness. | Live Arc subgraph, schema, mappings, score formula, trust boundaries. |

Each page answers the same four questions:

~~~text
What did Opaque build with this partner?
Why is it load-bearing rather than decorative?
What can a judge inspect live or in source?
What privacy boundary does the integration preserve?
